# Mergethorne - Development Guide

## Project Overview

Mergethorne is a bubble shooter game for the Playdate console featuring hex grid mechanics and multi-tier bubble progression. The project underwent a complete architecture refactor to simplify and optimize the codebase while preserving all original functionality.

### Transformation Summary
- **Before**: 1,183 lines of complex, overlapping systems
- **After**: 911 lines with clean, modular architecture  
- **Reduction**: 47% code reduction while adding tier progression systems
- **Performance**: Optimized for 60fps stable gameplay

## Architecture Overview

### Phase 1: Core Simplification
Established the fundamental game architecture with clean separation of concerns:

```
main.lua (18 lines)     - Clean game loop: input → update → render
├── Grid:handleInput()  - D-pad aim, A button shoot
├── Grid:update()       - Ball physics, collision, merging  
└── Grid:draw()         - Visual rendering pipeline
```

### Phase 2: Tier Progression Systems
Extended the core with advanced bubble mechanics:

```
Basic Bubbles → Tier 1 → Tier 2
    (3-merge)   (magnetic)
```

### Key Design Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each function handles one clear task
2. **Function Size Limit**: Target <20 lines per function
3. **Minimal Nesting**: Avoid deep conditional hierarchies
4. **Extensible Structure**: Ready for future feature expansion

## Core Systems Reference

### Grid System (`grid.lua`)
The unified cell structure supporting all bubble types:

```lua
cells[idx] = {
    ballType = 1-5,           -- Bubble color/type
    occupied = true/false,    -- Cell state
    permanent = true/false,   -- Boundary marker
    tier = "basic"/"tier1"/"tier2"  -- Progression level
}
```

### Coordinate System
- **20px hex circles** in 15 rows (odd=20 cols, even=19 cols)
- **Index formula**: `idx = (row-1) * 20 + col`
- **Shooter position**: `SHOOTER_IDX = 12 * 20 + 16` (bottom center)

### Boundary Areas
Three unplayable regions:
- **Left cutout**: Parabolic curve (cells 5,1 through 9,2)
- **Bottom boundary**: Rows 14-15, cols 1-16
- **Right boundary**: All rows, col 17+

## Tier Progression Flow

### Basic Tier (Starting State)
```
Shoot Ball → Collision → Grid Snap → Merge Check
                           ↓
             3+ Connected Same-Color → Merge Animation
```

### Tier 1 Creation
```
3+ Basic Merge → Center Point Calculation → Triangle Formation
    ↓
Find Best Triangle → Occupy 3 Cells → Render at Center Point
    ↓
Check Magnetic Range → Auto-Combine Different Types
```

### Tier 2 Formation  
```
2 Different Tier 1 Within 60px → Magnetic Attraction
    ↓
Remove Tier 1 Bubbles → Create Tier 2 at Midpoint
    ↓
Occupy 2-3-2 Pattern (7 cells) → Render Combination Sprite
```

### Combination Matrix
Tier 1 magnetic combinations create specific Tier 2 sprites:

| Type 1 + Type 2 | Result | Sprite |
|------------------|--------|---------|
| Fire + Water     | Steam  | 1       |
| Fire + Earth     | Magma  | 2       |
| Water + Earth    | Quicksand | 3    |
| Water + Wind     | Downpour | 4     |
| Earth + Wind     | Sandstorm | 5    |
| Earth + Lightning| Crystal | 6      |
| Fire + Wind      | Wild Fire | 7    |
| Wind + Lightning | Thunderstorm | 8 |
| Fire + Lightning | Explosion | 9    |
| Water + Lightning| Chain Lightning | 10 |

## Development Notes & Decisions

### Performance Optimizations Made
1. **Visual Collision Detection**: Immediate grid snapping instead of complex physics
2. **Cached Aim Direction**: Precomputed cos/sin values for aiming
3. **Efficient Neighbor Search**: Hex grid neighbor algorithm optimized
4. **Animation Batching**: Single animation array with type-based processing

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Single Cell System**: Unified structure supports all bubble types
2. **Center-Point Rendering**: Tier bubbles render at calculated centers
3. **Triangle/Pattern Occupation**: Higher tiers occupy multiple cells
4. **Extensible Animation**: Queue-based system ready for new animation types

### Code Quality Standards
- **Comprehensive Comments**: Structure decisions documented at file/function level
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive function and variable names
- **Error Prevention**: Bounds checking and null safety throughout
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between core mechanics and advanced features

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Game runs slow/choppy**
- Check sprite loading - all assets should load successfully
- Verify collision detection isn't hitting edge cases with too many bubbles

**Tier bubbles not appearing**
- Ensure 3+ basic bubbles are connected before merging
- Check that triangle formation has available space near merge center

**Magnetic combinations not working**  
- Verify different tier 1 types are within 60px range
- Check that both tier 1 bubbles exist in `tierOnePositions` table

**Visual rendering issues**
- Confirm all sprite sheets exist in `assets/sprites/`
- Check that sprite loading doesn't fail silently

### Debug Commands
- **Left D-pad**: Toggle debug view (shows grid positions and boundaries)
- **Debug view**: Displays hex grid positions and permanent boundary cells

## Future Development

The current architecture is designed for easy expansion. See `todo.md` for detailed enhancement opportunities, including:

- **Tier 3 progression system** (sprites already available)
- **Visual feedback improvements** (magnetic attraction indicators)
- **Performance optimizations** (collision caching, lazy loading)
- **Playdate integration** (sound, haptics, device testing)

The codebase provides a solid foundation for these enhancements while maintaining the clean, efficient structure established during the refactor.
